The data_description.txt, sample_submission.csv, test.csv, and train.csv files were extracted from the kaggle dataset and placed together in a folder.

The motive of this project was to develop a regression model to predict the house prices 
Training and Testing was done on the dataset using many different models such as RandomForest, GradientBoost, and XGBoost and it was found that XGBoost was the most optimal and best one. 

After the process has been completed the predicted prices are saved into a new csv file(my_submission.csv)
