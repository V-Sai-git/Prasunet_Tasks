The goal of this project is to develop a hand gesture recognition model that can accurately identify and classify different hand gestures from image or video data.

This is accomplished by utilizing data for training from the Hand Gesture Recognition Database on Kaggle.
The dataset comprises 10 different hand-gestures that were performed by 10 different subjects (5 men and 5 women). These images were acquired by a Leap Motion sensor.

Enabling intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control system was the ultimate motive.
