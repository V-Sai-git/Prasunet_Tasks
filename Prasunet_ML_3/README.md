In this phase of the task the mission is to develop an SVM algorithm that classifies two different classes off images (cats and dogs).
The model was trained with the help of data from train.csv and tested using the data from test.csv provided from Kaggle. 

Implement a support vector machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle dataset.
